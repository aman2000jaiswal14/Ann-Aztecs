        <h1  id="Irr">Irrigation</h1>
        <p>In general, the goal of irrigation is to supply the entire ﬁeld homogeneously with water, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little. Irrigation in India is done through wells, tanks, canals, perennial canal, and multi-purpose river valley projects.
          Surface Irrigation:
          In this technique water ﬂows and spreads over the surface of the land. Varied quantities of water are allowed on the ﬁelds at diﬀerent times. Therefore, ﬂow of water under surface irrigation comes under wobbly ﬂow. 
          Basin irrigation: Basin irrigation is common practice of surface irrigation. This method is employed for watering orchards (Basak, 1999). It is useful especially in regions with layouts of small ﬁelds (Shah et al. 2002). If a ﬁeld is level in all directions, is encompassed by a dyke to prevent runoﬀ, and provides an undirected ﬂow of water onto the ﬁeld, it is herein called a basin. A basin is typically square in shape but exists in all sorts of irregular and rectangular conﬁgurations. It may be furrowed or ridged, have raised beds for the beneﬁt of certain crops, but as long as the inﬂow is undirected and uncontrolled into these ﬁeld modiﬁcations, it remains a basin.
          Free Flooding:
          This ﬂooding system of irrigation is used from ancient times. Flooding method consists in applying the water by ﬂooding the land of rather smooth and ﬂat topography. In current irrigation practice, several ﬂooding methods have been developed. In free ﬂooding method, water is applied to the land from ﬁeld ditches without any check or guidance to the ﬂow. The land is 
          divided into plots or kiaries of suitable size depending on porosity of soil. Water is spread over the ﬁeld from watercourse. The irrigation operation begins at the higher area and proceeds towards the lower levels. The ﬂow is stopped when the lower end of the ﬁeld has received the desired depth of water. The ﬁeld watercourse is properly spaced, the spacing depends on the topography, oil texture, depth of soil and size of stream. 
          Well and Tube Well Irrigation:
          A well is a hole dug in the ground to get the subsoil water. Normal well is about 3-5 metres deep but deeper wells up-to 15 metres are also dug. This system of irrigation has been used in India from ancient time. Various methods are used to lift the ground water from the well for irrigation, drinking, bathing and for other purposes. Well irrigation is more popular in those regions where ground water is in ample and where there are few canals.
          Canal Irrigation Most of the canals provide perennial irrigation and supply water as and when required. This saves the crops from drought conditions and helps in increasing the farm production. Canals carry a lot of residue brought down by the rivers. This sediment is deposited in the agricultural ﬁelds which make soil more fertile. Some of the canals are parts of multipurpose projects and, therefore, provide inexpensive source of irrigation. Although the initial cost involved in canal irrigation is more, it is quite cheap in the long run.
