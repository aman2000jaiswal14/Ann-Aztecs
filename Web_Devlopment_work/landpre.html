<p >Once a suitable area for establishing the plantation is selected and the planning operation is ﬁ nalised, the actual preparation can be activated. These activities are divided to structure and pace the implementation process in order to be ready for planting at the most suitable time, according to the speciﬁ c regional climatic conditions.
2.1 Mechanical ﬁ eld preparation
The mechanical or initial soil preparation concerns mainly the preparation of a ﬁ eld for further detailed preparation such as irrigation system installation, hole preparation, etc. Actions, if applicable to the area, include:
(i) debushing/bush clearing;
(ii) removal of stones and rocks;
(iii) ripping; and
(iv) levelling of the soil.
2.2 Irrigation system installation
The type of irrigation system to be used will be determined by the availability of water, topographical and soil conditions. When the initial soil preparation is completed, the installation of the required irrigation system will be implemented according to the prescribed design (Figure 55).
In saline soils (soluble salts present as chlorides, sulphates and/or carbonates of calcium, sodium or magnesium), only leaching will be necessary to drain the excess salts. In the case of alkaline and/or salinealkaline soils, sodium can be replaced through the application of gypsum or acidifying agents like sulphur. Once the sodium has been replaced, a programme should be followed to leach it out.
When the irrigation water is of poor quality, proper drainage and over irrigation, without the development of a water table, is very important.
Hole preparation
The actual digging of the hole is one of the last actions before planting takes place, but it must be emphasised that this is not the ﬁ nal preparation for the planting operation itself. This is the point where the required inputs such as gypsum and organic materials are worked into the soil and a start is made with the leaching programme. The reason why the leaching is only applied at 
this stage is because of the relatively small area that is occupied by the date palm. If the total area had to be leached, it would become very costly with little or no beneﬁ t in the long run.
It is recommended that a hole of 1 m³ be prepared and that the soil from the hole be mixed with the organic material and gypsum (Figures 56 and 57). The soil mix is then put back into the hole, whereafter the site is clearly marked for positioning of the small date palm plants.
At this stage, once the hole has been prepared and closed, it is irrigated and a leaching programme implemented. The water supply will then enhance the leaching of excessive salts and contribute to the fermentation process of the organic material. Subsequent irrigation, several times (2 to 3) before planting, will also allow the mixed soil to settle in the hole.
In most soils, the early and rapid growth of the date plant is better when the holes are prepared one to two months before planting. Well-rotted manure can also be used in holes prepared and irrigated shortly before planting, but extreme care must be taken to put the manure (and fertilisers) deep enough to allow a layer of soil at least 15 to 20 cm thick to be placed between the manure and the roots of the date plant.</p>
