        <h1 class="head">Sowing</h1>
            <p id="sow">Sowing or seeding is an art of placing seeds in the soil to have good germination in the ﬁeld. A perfect seeding gives correct amount of seed per unit area, correct depth at which seed is placed in the soil and correct spacing between row-to-row and plant to plant.
                Methods of sowing 
                There are diﬀerent methods of sowing such as Broadcasting, Dibbling, Drilling, Seed dropping behind the plough, Transplanting, Hill dropping and Check row planting.
                i) Broadcasting
                Broadcasting is the process of random scattering of seed on the surface of seedbeds. It can be done manually or mechanically both. When broadcasting is done manually, uniformity of seed depends upon skill of the man. Soon after broadcasting the seeds are covered by planking or some other devices. Usually higher seed rate is obtained in this system. Mechanical broadcasters are used for large-scale work. This machine scatters the seeds on the surface of the seedbed at controlled rates.
                ii) Dibbling
                Dibbling is the process of placing seeds in holes made in seedbed and covering them. In this method, seeds are placed in holes made at deﬁnite depth at ﬁxed spacing. The equipment used for dibbling is called dibbler. It is a conical instrument used to make proper holes in the ﬁeld. Small hand dibblers are made with several conical projections made in a frame. This is very time consuming process, so it is not suitable for small seeds. Mostly vegetables are sown in this way.
                iii) Drilling
                Drilling consists of dropping the seeds in furrow lines in a continuous ﬂow and covering them with soil. Seed metering may be done either manually or mechanically. The number of rows planted may be one or more. This method is very helpful in achieving proper depth, proper spacing and proper amount of seed to be sown in the ﬁeld. Drilling can be done by (1) Sowing behind the plough (2) Bullock drawn seed drills (3) Tractor drawn seed drills.
                iv) Seed dropping behind the plough
                It is very common method used in villages. It is used for seed like maize, gram, peas, wheat and barley. A man drops seeds in the furrow behind the plough. Sowing behind the plough can be done by a device known as malobansa. It consists of a bamboo tube provided with a funnel shaped mouth. One man drops the seeds through the funnel and other man handles the plough and the bullocks. This is a slow and laborious method.
                v) Transplanting
                Transplanting consists of preparing seedlings in nursery and then planting these seedlings in the prepared ﬁeld. It is commonly done for vegetable and ﬂowers. It is very time consuming operation. Equipment for placing plants in the soil is called transplanter.
                vi) Hill dropping
                
                In this method, seeds are dropped at ﬁxed spacing and not in a continuous stream. Thus the spacing between plant to plant in a row is constant. In case of drills, the seeds are dropped in continuous stream and the spacing between plant to plant in a row is not constant.
                vii) Check row planting
                It is a method of planting, in which row-to-row and plant-to-plant distance is uniform. In this method, seeds are planted precisely along straight parallel furrows. The rows are always in two perpendicular directions. A machine used for check row planting is called check row planter.

                <h1 class="head">Land Preparation</h1>
<p id="land">Once a suitable area for establishing the plantation is selected and the planning operation is ﬁ nalised, the actual preparation can be activated. These activities are divided to structure and pace the implementation process in order to be ready for planting at the most suitable time, according to the speciﬁ c regional climatic conditions.
    2.1 Mechanical ﬁ eld preparation
    The mechanical or initial soil preparation concerns mainly the preparation of a ﬁ eld for further detailed preparation such as irrigation system installation, hole preparation, etc. Actions, if applicable to the area, include:
    (i) debushing/bush clearing;
    (ii) removal of stones and rocks;
    (iii) ripping; and
    (iv) levelling of the soil.
    2.2 Irrigation system installation
    The type of irrigation system to be used will be determined by the availability of water, topographical and soil conditions. When the initial soil preparation is completed, the installation of the required irrigation system will be implemented according to the prescribed design (Figure 55).
     In saline soils (soluble salts present as chlorides, sulphates and/or carbonates of calcium, sodium or magnesium), only leaching will be necessary to drain the excess salts. In the case of alkaline and/or salinealkaline soils, sodium can be replaced through the application of gypsum or acidifying agents like sulphur. Once the sodium has been replaced, a programme should be followed to leach it out.
    When the irrigation water is of poor quality, proper drainage and over irrigation, without the development of a water table, is very important.
    Hole preparation
    The actual digging of the hole is one of the last actions before planting takes place, but it must be emphasised that this is not the ﬁ nal preparation for the planting operation itself. This is the point where the required inputs such as gypsum and organic materials are worked into the soil and a start is made with the leaching programme. The reason why the leaching is only applied at 
    this stage is because of the relatively small area that is occupied by the date palm. If the total area had to be leached, it would become very costly with little or no beneﬁ t in the long run.
    It is recommended that a hole of 1 m³ be prepared and that the soil from the hole be mixed with the organic material and gypsum (Figures 56 and 57). The soil mix is then put back into the hole, whereafter the site is clearly marked for positioning of the small date palm plants.
    At this stage, once the hole has been prepared and closed, it is irrigated and a leaching programme implemented. The water supply will then enhance the leaching of excessive salts and contribute to the fermentation process of the organic material. Subsequent irrigation, several times (2 to 3) before planting, will also allow the mixed soil to settle in the hole.
    In most soils, the early and rapid growth of the date plant is better when the holes are prepared one to two months before planting. Well-rotted manure can also be used in holes prepared and irrigated shortly before planting, but extreme care must be taken to put the manure (and fertilisers) deep enough to allow a layer of soil at least 15 to 20 cm thick to be placed between the manure and the roots of the date plant.</p>

          <h1 class="head">Irrigation</h1>
          <p id="Irr">In general, the goal of irrigation is to supply the entire ﬁeld homogeneously with water, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little. Irrigation in India is done through wells, tanks, canals, perennial canal, and multi-purpose river valley projects.
            Surface Irrigation:
            In this technique water ﬂows and spreads over the surface of the land. Varied quantities of water are allowed on the ﬁelds at diﬀerent times. Therefore, ﬂow of water under surface irrigation comes under wobbly ﬂow. 
            Basin irrigation: Basin irrigation is common practice of surface irrigation. This method is employed for watering orchards (Basak, 1999). It is useful especially in regions with layouts of small ﬁelds (Shah et al. 2002). If a ﬁeld is level in all directions, is encompassed by a dyke to prevent runoﬀ, and provides an undirected ﬂow of water onto the ﬁeld, it is herein called a basin. A basin is typically square in shape but exists in all sorts of irregular and rectangular conﬁgurations. It may be furrowed or ridged, have raised beds for the beneﬁt of certain crops, but as long as the inﬂow is undirected and uncontrolled into these ﬁeld modiﬁcations, it remains a basin.
            Free Flooding:
            This ﬂooding system of irrigation is used from ancient times. Flooding method consists in applying the water by ﬂooding the land of rather smooth and ﬂat topography. In current irrigation practice, several ﬂooding methods have been developed. In free ﬂooding method, water is applied to the land from ﬁeld ditches without any check or guidance to the ﬂow. The land is 
            divided into plots or kiaries of suitable size depending on porosity of soil. Water is spread over the ﬁeld from watercourse. The irrigation operation begins at the higher area and proceeds towards the lower levels. The ﬂow is stopped when the lower end of the ﬁeld has received the desired depth of water. The ﬁeld watercourse is properly spaced, the spacing depends on the topography, oil texture, depth of soil and size of stream. 
            Well and Tube Well Irrigation:
            A well is a hole dug in the ground to get the subsoil water. Normal well is about 3-5 metres deep but deeper wells up-to 15 metres are also dug. This system of irrigation has been used in India from ancient time. Various methods are used to lift the ground water from the well for irrigation, drinking, bathing and for other purposes. Well irrigation is more popular in those regions where ground water is in ample and where there are few canals.
            Canal Irrigation Most of the canals provide perennial irrigation and supply water as and when required. This saves the crops from drought conditions and helps in increasing the farm production. Canals carry a lot of residue brought down by the rivers. This sediment is deposited in the agricultural ﬁelds which make soil more fertile. Some of the canals are parts of multipurpose projects and, therefore, provide inexpensive source of irrigation. Although the initial cost involved in canal irrigation is more, it is quite cheap in the long run.

            <h1 class="head">Harvesting</h1>
            <p id="harvest">
                Harvesting is the process of collecting the mature rice crop from the ﬁeld. Paddy harvesting activities include reaping, stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. These can be done individually or a combine harvester can be used to perform the operations simultaneously.
It is important to apply good harvesting methods to be able to maximize grain yield, and minimize grain damage and quality deterioration.
Harvesting rice consists of the basic operations which can be done in individual steps or in combination using a combine harvester. These include:
• Reaping - cutting the mature panicles and straw above ground
• Threshing - separating the paddy grain from the rest of cut crop
• Cleaning - removing immature, unﬁlled, non-grain materials
• Hauling - moving the cut crop to the threshing location
• Field drying - leaving the cut crop in the ﬁeld and exposing it to the sun for drying (optional)
• Stacking/piling - temporarily storing the harvested crop in stacks or piles (optional)
• Bagging - putting the threshed grain in bags for transport and storage

Traditional harvesting activities such as ﬁeld drying and stacking/piling are not recommended because they can lead to rapid quality deterioration and increased harvest losses.
Besides these, a variety of other activities can be included in harvesting such as gathering, reaping (gathering standing grain by cutting), bundling, and various forms of transporting the crop and grain.
